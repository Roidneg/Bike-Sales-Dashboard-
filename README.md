Bike Sales Dashboard - Basic Data Anaylitics Project (Excel)
This project is a demonstration of Excel skills, focused on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project uses data provided by Alex the Analyst Youtube Channel's Excel Project video, which was preprocessed before starting the analysis. The project consists of the following steps:

Data cleaning: The first step in the project was to remove any duplicates from the dataset to ensure that the analysis is accurate and consistent.

Variable renaming: To improve the readability and usability of the dataset, some variable names were renamed.

Age bracket creation: A new column was created using a nested IF statement to categorize customers into age brackets for easy analysis.

Pivot table creation: Three pivot tables were created to analyze the data. The first pivot table shows the average income per purchase, the second pivot table shows customer age brackets, and the third pivot table shows customer commute.

Visualization: Each pivot table was given a graphical representation to make it easier to interpret the results.

Dashboard creation: All three pivot tables were copied and pasted into a new worksheet to create a dashboard. Slicers were added to the dashboard, which were connected to each pivot table. The slicers include marital status, region, and education.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills in using Excel to clean, sort, and analyze data. The project showcases the ability to use pivot tables, graphs, and slicers to create an interactive dashboard that can be used for analysis and decision-making.
